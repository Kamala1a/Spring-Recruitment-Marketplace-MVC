<p><p><strong>What is UniHyr?</strong></p>
<p>UniHyr is a first of its kind online marketplace (platform) that brings together large number of employers and hiring consultants so that employers can deeper penetration in the talent pool and get the right talent in super quick time. At the same time, it also helps consultants to increase their visibility and reach to potential employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How UniHyr can help me to increase my Business Revenue?</strong></p>
<p>Once hiring partner (consultant) signs up on the platform, they get access to a large number of positions posted by the clients (that are part of the UniHyr platform) from various industries. The consultant can review the hiring requirements of these clients and work on those positions. If their candidate is selected, they can earn recruitment fee thus multiplying their earning potential without really getting into any kind of Business Development. It also helps the consultants to monetize their database of profiles across a large cross section of requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there any fee for using platform?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no fee for using a platform. It is absolutely free. UniHyr will charge a nominal commission once the position gets closed.</p>
<p><strong>What will be the payment terms?</strong></p>
<p>Once UniHyr receives payment from the client as per the agreed payment days, UniHyr will transfer the payment to the consultant within 15 working days of receiving payment from the client.</p>
<p><strong>How will I generate invoice to UniHyr and how will I get the payment after closing any position?</strong></p>
<p>The entire invoice generation process is automated and consultant need not separately be required to raise invoice to UniHyr. Once the candidate joins the client organization, invoice is verified by the client. At the same time, the consultant would need to update the invoice number in the Billing Details section and Generate the invoice. Based on the fixed CTC offered, offered fee%, and commission, an automatic invoice would be generated.</p>
<p>Typically, the consultant receives payment within 15 days of the UniHyr receiving the payment from the Client.</p>
<p><strong>How can I know if any of the clients has posted a requirement?</strong></p>
<p>If the clients posted any position, you will get a notification once you login into your account. You can see the details of the new positions in &ldquo;New Positions Tab&rdquo;. In NEW Position tab you can see the details like Industry, compensation range, experience range and location. You can review requirements and choose the positions you want to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Can I choose positions I want to work on?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Under &ldquo;New Position Tab&rdquo; you can see the details, of the new requirements by the clients. All those positions on which you want to work on, you can specify the fee (within a prescribed range) and add those positions to your active positions (you can see your active positions on home page tab). You will get 15 days to move the jobs in active position. On 15<sup>th</sup> day it will automatically gets removed from the &ldquo;New Positions Tab&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to sign the contract with the client also?</strong></p>
<p>No, you will not sign the contract with employer. All you need to do is sign a contract with UniHyr.</p>
<p><strong>What if I have an existing relationship with an employer that&rsquo;s using UniHyr?</strong></p>
<p>When position details are shown under New Positions tab, the client name is not disclosed for reasons of confidentiality. However, once the consultant decides to work on it by adding it to its Active Positions, the client name is revealed. Once added, the platform would start measuring the consultant performance which would impact his ratings. In case you believe that one of the requirement is from your existing client then you can drop in a line to Helpdesk to check if the client is same or not.</p>
<p><strong>How can I know if my submitted profile has been shortlisted for an interview or finally selected?</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the profile you submitted gets shortlisted for any interview or joined you will get the notifications for the update as well you can see the status of profile under your manage positions tab.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I see the detailed billing information?</strong></p>
<p>In billing tab, you can see the detailed billing information for all the positions you have closed with all the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>How many CVs can I upload for any opening?</strong></p>
<p>For every position posted by a client, the client sets a profile quota. This quota defines the maximum number of profiles a consultant can upload on that position in a week long period.</p>
<p><strong>What is Profile Quota?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Profile quota limits the consultants to upload the number of resumes against a particular position. Client will set this profile quota against every position. For example, if employer sets a profile quota of 5 against any position, you can upload only five resume against the same position.</p>
<p><strong>What are the different stages for the profile which I will see in my panel?</strong></p>
<p>Once the consultant submits the profile the first stage would be <strong>Pending</strong> which means the profile is pending for review by client. Now client can either shortlist of reject. If shortlisted profile would move to <strong>In Process</strong> &nbsp;which means candidate has been shortlisted for interview. Post In Process, candidate can be rejected or moved to <strong>To be Offered</strong> stage which means that candidate is being offered. Post this the profile moves to <strong>Offer Accepted</strong> stage if the candidate accepts offer. At each of these stages, the profile can be rejected as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Once Offer Accepted stage is reached, the consultant would need to notify Joining or Offer Drop using his panel. Once the candidate joins and consultant notifies Joined, then the invoice to the client is generated.</p></div>
